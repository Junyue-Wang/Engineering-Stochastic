# Stochastic Process

ORIE 5510 at Cornell University

It's a stochastic process course from an theoretical/modeling angle. 
In this repository, I upload the project for this course, incorporating markov chain modeling and deep learning neural network towards inventory problem. 

Topics for the course

Discrete / Continuous Time Markov Chain
Martingales and Optional Sampling
Brownian Motion
Poisson Process
Jackson Queueing Network
Open/Closed Network analysis
Rate of convergence / QED
